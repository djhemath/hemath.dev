Hey folks,

Q1 of 2024 was filled with surprises and new experiences. From an unforgettable birthday surprise and an unintentional pre-birthday celebration to a spontaneous trip to Pondicherry and my mom’s first BBQ dinner, these months were all about laughter, exploration, and creating lasting memories.

## January
Started with a great birthday which I ever had. A surprised visit of Sai, Ramya and Ragav in the middle of the night with a cake was insane. I never got such suriprise birthdays.

And one of my good friends, also a sister "Rij" brought me a cake for my birthday. But she forgot the actual date and ended up visiting me a day before my birthday. It’s kind of a new experience to cut my birthday cake before a day. Her face when she realized that Jan 20 isn’t my birthday was funny.

She brought a birthday hat, it’s my first time having one.

## February
Went for a nice trip to Pondichery with a good friend Maries. The plan is to just go there, chill and enjoy. No serious goals or itinerary. Got a bike from Raj another college friend and cruised non-stop to Pondichery.

Had a great lunch, slept in the noon and went for a breezy walk at Rock beach. That was a great experience. It was my first time going for a walk in Rock beach. We shopped some decorative lights and other stuff. And made our way to a fancy French restaurant named ["The Promenade"](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Promenade/@11.9332992,79.8331541,17z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x3a53622caf0cef77:0x8a37188ff71b58e7!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d11.933294!4d79.835729!16s%2Fg%2F1tp0c2tl?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). It was costly, we just had deserts becuase that's what we were able to afford. But we never thought that they were deserts, we thought they were some sort of dish. And ordered Quiche and ate almost half of it and then realized that it is pork. I never had pork in my life and this sudden discovery made it disgusting. Just gave the remaining to him without telling him xD.

## March
It's a month of ex-girlfriend's birth month. Also the birth month of Rij. Me, Rij and my mom went for a cool BBQ dinner. It was a great dinner with some nice talks. BTW, this is my mom's first ever BBQ experience. Everyone was happy!
