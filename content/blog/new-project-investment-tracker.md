Starting up another hobby project here. It's an investment tracker. This little tool's gonna help me keep tabs on my investments and figure out how much I'm making from each one.

I've seen loads of investment trackers out there, but not many of them show the profit breakdown for each investment. My main jams are BTC and Gold; no stocks, nothin' else.

I'm keeping it simple, sticking to INR for now. Gold'll be in grams and BTC as BTC.

So, I'm sketching out this app that'll let me jot down dates and amounts invested, then spit out a clean chart and some nifty stats.

At the end of the day, I just wanna know how much I've thrown in and how much I've made.

Best part? No sign-ups needed. Just punch in your investments, hit calculate, peek at the analytics, and save it all as a CSV. Next time, just import that file and pick up where you left off.

Down the road, I might add some user-friendly features so you don't have to mess with exporting and importing all the time. But for now, it's just me. And if things go well, maybe I'll spruce it up with sign-ups, cooler analytics, and more.

But right now, it's just for me, super straightforward.

I'm gonna wireframe, design, and build this thing solo, and I'm doing it out in the open to keep myself on track. No more half-finished projects for me.

Got a rough sketch of what I'm aiming for; it's the blueprint phase for now.

This is a very rough version, need to work more on good wireframe and followed by actual design.
