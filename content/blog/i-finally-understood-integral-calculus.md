excerpt: I’ve always struggled with math, but I’ve decided to revisit Calculus to truly understand Machine Learning. It wasn’t easy—had to watch the basics twice and still felt lost. But after a chat with ChatGPT, it finally made sense! Excited to share my perspective on it soon.

Hello makkals,

I always wanted to learn Machine learning in the right way. I initially read about types of ML algorithms and even built some projects in college. But I don't have a knowledge about how things internally work. In ML, as per my knowledge, every thing boils down to mathematics. And I'm **super bad** at that.

I completed Linear algebra May last year. And was about to start Calculus. But I ended up pausing the math till now. Yeah, classic Hemath!

But got the energy to start Calculus. Started watching the [3Blue1Brown's Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) playlist. This is one of the great contents for Calculus in the internet. Previously I followed the same channel for Linear Algebra.

I had to watch the first video 2 times to somewhat understand the concept of calculus. But still after that, I didn't understand much, because there is basically a lot to process in mind. And my brain is just a single-threaded processor when it comes to mathematics, it can't handle multiple things at once.

However after those couple of watches, I had a chat with ChatGPT. Boy-oh-boy, it clarified me in a way that I would understand. All of a sudden, I understood calculus!

I definitely need to write a post explaining what is calculus in my own terms. Putting it in my todo list for now.
