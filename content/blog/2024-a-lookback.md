Hey folks,

Hope y'all doing great. 2024 was a rollercoaster year for me. A lot of stuff happened. Many ups, dips and U-turns. Just reflecting on what happened in 2024 overall month by month.

### January
Started with a great birthday which I ever had. A surprised visit of Sai, Ramya and Ragav in the middle of the night with a cake was insane. I never got such suriprise birthdays.

And one of my good friends, also a sister "Rij" brought me a cake for my birthday. But she forgot the actual date and ended up visiting me a day before my birthday. It’s kind of a new experience to cut my birthday cake before a day. Her face when she realized that Jan 20 isn’t my birthday was funny.

She brought a birthday hat, it’s my first time having one.

### February
Went for a nice trip to Pondichery with a good friend Maries. The plan is to just go there, chill and enjoy. No serious goals or itinerary. Got a bike from Raj another college friend and cruised non-stop to Pondichery.

Had a great lunch, slept in the noon and went for a breezy walk at Rock beach. That was a great experience. It was my first time going for a walk in Rock beach. We shopped some decorative lights and other stuff. And made our way to a fancy French restaurant named ["The Promenade"](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Promenade/@11.9332992,79.8331541,17z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x3a53622caf0cef77:0x8a37188ff71b58e7!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d11.933294!4d79.835729!16s%2Fg%2F1tp0c2tl?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). It was costly, we just had deserts becuase that's what we were able to afford. But we never thought that they were deserts, we thought they were some sort of dish. And ordered Quiche and ate almost half of it and then realized that it is pork. I never had pork in my life and this sudden discovery made it disgusting. Just gave the remaining to him without telling him xD.

### March
It's a month of ex-girlfriend's birth month. Also the birth month of Rij. Me, Rij and my mom went for a cool BBQ dinner. It was a great dinner with some nice talks. BTW, this is my mom's first ever BBQ experience. Everyone was happy!

### April
April was a packed month. A lot of activities happened in a single month.

#### Night cycle ride to Mahabs
Went on a awesome night cycle ride to Mahabalipuram with Sai, Ragav and Soori. Talked about a lot of stuff in different topics along the ride.

#### Trip to Kona falls
I went to my Grandma's home near Tirutani for a weekend. And we friends together made a sudden plan and decided to go Kona falls to cool off the hot sunny day. And oh-boy it became an awesome hiking experience.

Initially we just wanted to enjoy in the falls. But it's summer and water flow is not that good. So we settled in a little pool nearby the falls and enjoyed. It's a hill forest. And what I do in a Hill Forest? Fucking hike it!

I convinced every one of them to come with me in the hike. There wasn't a well defined path anywhere. We just hiked to random places. We found a small cave. Went inside and took pictures. There was a little opening on top of the cave, we climbed top of it and found a drained river path. We followed it until a complete block path. There was a huge rock which is not possible to climb without any ropes and equipments. So we called it as end, spend some time there and got back to falls. It was completely unplanned and a great experience. And with my friends, this is so natural to have this kind of unplanned stuff always!

Karthi, Surya and Aakash are missing in the pictures `:(`

#### Ghilli movie re-release
I was a very big fan the movie [Ghilli](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0422320/). In fact, it was my first ever movie that I watched in the theatre in my childhood. A lot of my friends love this movie too.

I was re-released in theatres in April. Oh boy, how would I miss that? I asked my mom and friends. Nobody was ready to come with me on that day. It was Monday, so nobody wants to watch a movie on Monday morning. But I wanted to experience that.

And also this was my first ever solo watch. I was fully onboard and it was a great experience. That Arjunar Villu song is the trigger!

#### First ever tech meetup
It was that time I was little bit frustrated with my career. It started feeling bore and my interest was lowering day by day. That's when I suddenly saw a post in Linkedin about a tech meetup happening nearby. It was organized ["Chennai React"](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chennaireact/) community. It was their 2nd meetup and I signed up for it. It was an unique experience. Me and Ragav went for it. I won a prize in the quiz session!

#### No agenda coffee
At the same time, I was feeling low with my people skills. I became more and more introvert during WFH period. So I called a very good friend [Thina](https://gsthina.me/) and told him about the situation. He is mentor and founder of a community solely focused on College students called ["Think Digital"](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/thinkdigital-community/). I just asked him if I could join and help out students with their technological improvements. I was initially thinking of teaching tech concepts, but even ready to mentor students with the general life.

And Thina agreed! Without any hesitation. He invited me to a unusual meetup he was doing called "No agenda coffee". It was just having a coffee without any agenda as the name implies. Got to meet some students, exchanged information and even answered some of their burning questions. At the end, a book for each of us was distributed. I got "Think like a Monk" and read most of it.

#### Became a mentor at Think Digital
With that No Agenda Coffee, I officially became a mentor at Think Digital, open to help anyone on anything I could. It always feels nice to give back something to the community. It brings some sort of peace. I don't know it could be a placebo. But for me, it brings a sense of peace and happiness.
