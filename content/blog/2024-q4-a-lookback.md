Hey guys,

Q4 was a rollercoaster of emotions and events. From night cycling adventures and spotting Bitcoin graffiti to launching SnapNostr, which received overwhelming support. I ran my first 5K marathon, faced bittersweet personal news, and navigated the trauma of Sanjay's accident and recovery. Volunteering at SheBuilds wrapped up the year with a sense of purpose and gratitude.

## Oct
### Another night cycle ride
Yet another night cycle ride with Sai and Ragav. This time we only went to Kovalam. We talked about random things the whole night and returned back. On the way, we saw a Bitcoin graffiti work in Muttukadu bridge and took a photo!

### Got RCT's done
Finally got the courage to get my Root canals done. It was frustrating before RCT, I couldn't eat anything freely. Can't even drink cool drinks. I had enough and I decided to get it done. After some appointments, completed RCT for 3 upper teeth. Now it's stable and I can eat and drink normally

## Nov
November was the month where I've seen a peak happiness and sadness.

### Launched SnapNostr
As I got very interested in Nostr, I built a tool that generates a good looking image of Nostr notes. It is inspired by [poet.so](https://poet.so)

I called it [SnapNostr](https://snapnostr.app), Sai bought me the domain. Initially, I thought that I won't get any traction. No one would look at it. Even if that was the case, only a few will use it. I launched it by making a post in Nostr. Shared the same in Whatsapp, Telegram, and other media and went to sleep.

For some reason, I wasn't able to sleep. So around 2AM midnight, I woke up and checked Nostr. Oh man, there was a around 70+ notifications in Nostr. Many people started using it. People started meme-ing it, and sharing it. I was overwhelmed by the response. I didn't sleep all night. I was just replying to all the comments and liking others' posts and helping out people who faced difficulty in using it (hopefully it was only couple of people found it difficult to use). I was very happy, but it was 6 AM in the morning, and I cannot be awake anymore. So I went to sleep with pure happiness.

### Ex-girlfriend married
At the same day, my ex-girlfriend got married. I explicitly told my friends not to inform if such an incident happened. But eventually I got notified. I woke up around 10.30 AM and saw the notification from my friends. And guess what, I went from total happiness (because of SnapNostr) to complete sadness. I know it was my ex-girlfriend, I was the one who broke up, but still I got the feeling for her. Shared this with Sai, talked with him and somehow managed to pass the day.

Wherever she was, with whomever she is now, she shall be happy. I wish her all the best for everything in her life, from my heart!

Somehow, I managed to get away from that feeling with SnapNostr, because people were constantly commenting and sharing, and things were pretty busy

### First ever Marathon
I finally got myself agree to run a short 5k marathon. Me and Karthi signed up for that months ago. My plan was to win it somehow. But, I realized I can't win within a minute of start. I was a regular jogger, but didn't jog for months. So I basically went there untrained. But somehow managed to finish the 5K at 31 minutes.

## Dec
### Sanjay's accident
We friends - Sanjay, Aby thomas and Hilal planned to go to Pondicherry for Arvind's house warming function. We boarded a bus and went to Pondicherry. It was almost 6 hours of travel to Arvind's home from Chennai. We reached there and had some chit chats. Finally, I managed to get everyone to say okay for a ride to Rock beach. It is a very nice place, especially in the weekend nights. We went there, tried different foods like hot dogs and stuff.

Sanjay wanted to eat Macrooni in place that he seen in the Instagram. We went there had the food as dinner. There was a grape juice we drank. It was great, there are real grapes cut in half in that juice. After all that, we started going back to home.

Me and Arvind went first in a bike, Sanjay was coming in a Scooty behind us and Aby Thomas and Hilal coming behind Sanjay. Sometime in the ride, Aby Thomas called me. He was telling that Sanjay met with an accident. Initially, me and Arvind thought that it was a prank. And we wanted that to be a prank. But it wasn't one. Aby mentioned that there was a dog crossed the road, and Sanjay tried not to hit it, but ended up losing the balance and fell in the road.

Sanjay was laying unconscious in the road. Covered with blood in his face and head. We couldn't believe what we are seeing. And I'm completely out of my mind. I wasn't focusing on anything except Sanjay. Me and Arvind searched for help. Luckily there was a person in car stepped to help us. We took Sanjay to a nearby hospital in that car. We couldn't thank that guy, because we were in an hurry.

Doctors done the first aid and initial nursing. And we took him to some scans and one of the doctor said that it's tough to cure him. They told us that he dying slowly. And they told that there is no neuro surgeon there and asked us to take him to some other hospital. We decided to take him to JIPMER hospital via ambulance.

And we were in emergency triage room the whole night, keeping Sanjay strapped in a stretcher. He was puking everything we had that night. He got some amount of conscious, he started speaking, but the words are meaningless. He was blabbering something randomly.

It seems that there were a blood leakage in his brain. And that causes him to act abnormal. We informed his mom and they were on their way to the hospital. Arvind's dad and brother came to hospital after hearing from us and helped us all night entirely.

I then had to come back to Chennai the next day morning because of another incident. Which I might cover in a separate post. I left the hospital traumatized.

On the same day, Aby Thomas and Hilal were also not able to stay there, leaving only Arvind behind. I felt very bad for Arvind, because he had to stay all alone there.

After a couple of days, Sanjay was brought to Stanley hospital in Chennai. The immediate next day, me and Aby Thomas went to hospital to check how is Sanjay doing. He was in the same condition. Unconscious most of the time, blabbers something when he wakes up. After some days of regular checking in, he started getting normal.

One day, me and Arvind went to hospital to check Sanjay, and Sanjay recognized us. I was very happy that he was able to recognize. But he was still far from getting normal. We helped him walk a little bit and returned back. After a week, he became mentally stable and started talking normal. Soon after, he was discharged to home.

He is now in his home, in complete rest. He is mentally good, but physically not. Luckily there was no dangerous physical damange. Some bruises and minor fractures. He survived the whole accident.

My mom prayed a lot, and after hearing this, me and my mom went to Tirutani temple.

Finally, everything came out well. Sanjay is now just days away from getting completely normal. And we hope it happens soon!

### SheBuilds meetup
SheBuilds is a tech community, mostly focused on women in tech. And they asked us, JS Lovers to help with organizing a meetup in Chennai. I was part of the crew. I volunteered by helping them arrange and deliver food to the venue. I also contributed to photos for a part of the event. It was a great event and I wrapped 2024 with this one!
