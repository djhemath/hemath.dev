Hello makkals,

It's been a while since I jumped in WebAssembly. I fell in love with the idea of WebAssembly. Built and worked in some cool projects. Now I decided share my knowledge with you all. This is going to be a series of blog posts that dives into many topics involving WebAssembly. At this point, I really don't know how many posts are going to be published. My rought guestimate tells at least 10 posts, but it may grow.

Nevertheless, worry not, I'll keep updating the this post with links of all the upcoming ones. This post is going to serve as an index for all other posts.

Almost every post is going to be practical-first so that everyone can understand the underlying theory by seeing clear examples.
